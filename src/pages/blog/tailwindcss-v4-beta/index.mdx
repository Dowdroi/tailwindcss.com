Last summer at Tailwind Connect [I shared a preview of Oxide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLkxRnRQtDE&t=2146s) — a new high-performance engine for Tailwind CSS that we've been working on, designed to simplify the developer experience and take advantage of how the web platform has evolved since Tailwind was first released.

About eight months ago we [open-sourced our progress](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha) on Tailwind CSS v4.0. Hundreds of hours of fixing bugs, soul-crushing backward compatibility work, and troubleshooting Windows CI failures later, I'm excited to finally tag the first public beta release.

As I talked about when we published the first alpha, Tailwind CSS v4.0 is an all-new engine built for performance, and designed for the modern web.

- **Built for performance** — full builds in the new engine are up to 5x faster, and incremental builds are over 100x faster — and measured in microseconds.
- **Unified toolchain** — build-in import handling, vendor prefixing, and syntax transforms, with no additional tooling required.
- **CSS-first configuration** — a reimagined developer experience where you customize and extend the framework directly in CSS instead of a JavaScript configuration file.
- **Designed for the modern web** — built on native cascade layers, wide-gamut colors, and including first-class support for modern CSS features like container queries, `@starting-style`, popovers, and more.

There's so much more to say, but everything you need to get started is in the new beta documentation we published today:

Start building and help us bullet-proof this thing for the stable release early in the new year.
