## Getting started

### Installing with Vite

If you're using Vite or a Vite-powered framework like SvelteKit or Remix, install Tailwind along with our new dedicated Vite plugin:

```bash {{ filename: 'Terminal' }}
$ npm install tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/vite@next
```

Next, add our Vite plugin to your `vite.config.ts` file:

```ts {{ filename: 'vite.config.ts' }}
  import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
> import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';

  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
>     tailwindcss()
    ],
  });
```

Finally, import Tailwind into your main CSS file:

```css  {{ filename: 'src/index.css' }}
> @import "tailwindcss";
```

### Installing with PostCSS

If your project uses PostCSS or you're using a framework like Next.js that supports PostCSS plugins, install Tailwind along with our new dedicated PostCSS plugin:

```bash {{ filename: 'Terminal' }}
$ npm install tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/postcss@next
```

Next, add our PostCSS plugin to your `postcss.config.js` file:

```js {{ filename: 'postcss.config.mjs' }}
  export default {
    plugins: {
>     '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
    },
  };
```

Finally, import Tailwind into your main CSS file:

```css  {{ filename: 'app.css' }}
> @import "tailwindcss";
```

### Installing the CLI

If you want to use our dedicated CLI tool, install Tailwind along with our new dedicated CLI package:

```bash {{ filename: 'Terminal' }}
$ npm install tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/cli@next
```

Next, import Tailwind into your main CSS file:

```css  {{ filename: 'app.css' }}
> @import "tailwindcss";
```

Then compile your CSS using the CLI tool:
```bash {{ filename: 'Terminal' }}
$ npx @tailwindcss/cli -i input.css -o output.css
```

You can also download [standalone builds](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v4.0.0-beta-1) of the new CLI tool from GitHub for projects that don't otherwise depend on the Node.js ecosystem.

### Upgrading from v3

If you'd like to try upgrading a project from v3 to the v4 beta releases, you can use our upgrade tool to do the vast majority of the heavy lifting for you:

```bash {{ filename: 'Terminal' }}
$ npx @tailwindcss/upgrade@next
```

For most projects, the upgrade tool will automate the entire migration process including:

- **Updating dependencies** like Tailwind itself, adding the new PostCSS plugin, updating our Prettier plugin if you have it installed, and removing dependencies that are no longer needed like `postcss-import` and `autoprefixer`.
- **Replacing `@tailwind` directives with `@import "tailwindcss"`** to modernize your project.
- **Migrating your config file to CSS** if possible, or updating your CSS to import your config file with `@config`.
- **Replacing deprecated utility classes** with their v4 equivalents, like renaming `outline-none` to `outline-hidden`.
- **Updating your variant order** so that order-sensitive variants in your utilities are sorted from left to right instead of right to left.
- **Replacing `theme(…)` with `var(…)`** where possible, taking advantage of the CSS variables generated in v4.0 by default.
- **Migrating to the new variable shorthand syntax**, updating utilities like `bg-[--my-color]` to `bg-(--my-color)`.
- **Adding compatibility base styles for Preflight changes**, so your project looks the same after upgrading.
- **Updating custom utilities to use `@utility`** instead of just custom classes in the `utilities` layer.
- **Updating existing imports to use layers** to make sure your custom styles behave as expected with Tailwind's layered styles.

**We recommend running the upgrade tool in a new branch**, then carefully reviewing the diff and testing your project in the browser to make sure all of the changes look correct. You may need to tweak a few things by hand in complex projects, but the tool will save you a ton of time either way.

It's also a good idea to go over all of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes) in v4.0 and get a good understanding of what's changed, in case there are other things you need to update in your project that the upgrade tool doesn't catch.

## What's new in v4.0

### CSS-first configuration

One of the biggest changes in Tailwind CSS v4.0 is the shift from configuring your project in JavaScript to configuring it in CSS.

Instead of a `tailwind.config.js` file, you can configure all of your customizations directly in the CSS file where you import Tailwind, giving you one less file to worry about in your project:

```css  {{ filename: 'app.css', style: 'framed', color: 'sky' }}
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  --font-display: "Satoshi", "sans-serif";

  --breakpoint-3xl: 1920px;

  --color-avocado-100: oklch(0.99 0 0);
  --color-avocado-200: oklch(0.98 0.04 113.22);
  --color-avocado-300: oklch(0.94 0.11 115.03);
  --color-avocado-400: oklch(0.92 0.19 114.08);
  --color-avocado-500: oklch(0.84 0.18 117.33);
  --color-avocado-600: oklch(0.53 0.12 118.34);

  --ease-fluid: cubic-bezier(0.3, 0, 0, 1);
  --ease-snappy: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1);

  /* ... */
}
```

The new CSS-first configuration lets you do just about everything you could do in your `tailwind.config.js` file, including configuring your design tokens, setting up content sources, defining custom utilities and variants, installing plugins, and more.

To learn more about how it all works, read the [CSS configuration in-depth](#css-configuration-in-depth) documentation.

### CSS theme variables

Tailwind CSS v4.0 takes all of your design tokens and makes them available as CSS variables by default, so you can reference any value you need at run-time using just CSS.

Using the example `@theme` from earlier, all of these values will be added to your CSS to as regular custom properties:

```css {{ filename: 'app.css', style: 'framed', color: 'indigo' }}
:root {
  --font-display: "Satoshi", "sans-serif";

  --breakpoint-3xl: 1920px;

  --color-avocado-100: oklch(0.99 0 0);
  --color-avocado-200: oklch(0.98 0.04 113.22);
  --color-avocado-300: oklch(0.94 0.11 115.03);
  --color-avocado-400: oklch(0.92 0.19 114.08);
  --color-avocado-500: oklch(0.84 0.18 117.33);
  --color-avocado-600: oklch(0.53 0.12 118.34);

  --ease-fluid: cubic-bezier(0.3, 0, 0, 1);
  --ease-snappy: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1);

  /* ... */
}
```

This makes it easy to reuse these values as inline styles or pass them to libraries like [Motion](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#css-variables) to animate them.

### Native CSS cascade layers

We're using real [CSS cascade layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) in v4.0, which make it easier than ever to control the precedence of styles and how they interact with each other.

```css {{ filename: 'dist.css', style: 'framed', color: 'purple', scroll: true }}
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;

@layer theme {
  :root {
    --font-sans: ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji',
    'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji';
    --font-serif: ui-serif, Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
    --font-mono: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, 'Liberation Mono',
      'Courier New', monospace;

    /* ... */
  }
}

@layer base {
  *,
  ::after,
  ::before,
  ::backdrop,
  ::file-selector-button {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    border: 0 solid;
  }

  /* ... */
}

@layer utilities {
  .pointer-events-none {
    pointer-events: none;
  }
  .visibility-hidden {
    visibility: hidden;
  }

  /* ... */

  .focus\:outline:focus {
    outline-width: 1px;
  }

  @media (width >= 40rem) {
    @media (hover: hover) {
      .sm\:hover\:opacity-100:hover {
        opacity: 100%;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We've had layers as a concept in Tailwind for years, but native cascade layers can do things that we couldn't easily replicate at build-time, like isolating styles within a layer even if they have a higher specificity than styles in another layer. Less code for us to maintain too!

### Automatic source detection

You know how you always had to configure that annoying `content` array in Tailwind CSS v3? In v4.0, we came up with a bunch of heuristics for detecting all of that stuff automatically so you don't have to configure it at all.

For example, we automatically ignore anything in your `.gitignore` file to avoid scanning dependencies or generated files that aren't under version control:

```bash {{ filename: '.gitignore', style: 'framed', color: 'fuchsia' }}
# dependencies
/node_modules

# testing
/coverage

# caches
/.next/

# production
/build
```

We also automatically ignore all binary extensions like images, videos, .zip files, and more.

And if you ever need to explicitly add a source that's excluded by default, you can always add it with the `@source` directive, right in your CSS file:

```css {{ filename: 'app.css', style: 'framed', color: 'pink' }}
  @import "tailwindcss";
> @source "../node_modules/@my-company/ui-lib";
```

The `@source` directive uses the same heuristics under the hood, so it will exclude binary file types for example as well, without you having to specify all of the extensions to scan explicitly.

### Built-in import support

Before v4.0, if you wanted to inline other CSS files using `@import` you'd have to configure another plugin like `postcss-import` to handle it for you.

Now we handle this out of the box, so you don't need to include another plugin:

```diff-js {{ filename: 'postcss.config.mjs', style: 'framed', color: 'sky' }}
  export default {
    plugins: {
-     'postcss-import': {},
      '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
    },
  };
```

Our import system is purpose-built for Tailwind CSS, so we've also been able to make it even faster by tightly integrating it with our engine.
