## Getting started

### Installing with Vite

If you're using Vite or a Vite-powered framework like SvelteKit or Remix, install Tailwind along with our new dedicated Vite plugin:

```bash {{ filename: 'Terminal' }}
$ npm install tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/vite@next
```

Next, add our Vite plugin to your `vite.config.ts` file:

```ts {{ filename: 'vite.config.ts' }}
  import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
> import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';

  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
>     tailwindcss()
    ],
  });
```

Finally, import Tailwind into your main CSS file:

```css  {{ filename: 'src/index.css' }}
> @import "tailwindcss";
```

### Installing with PostCSS

If your project uses PostCSS or you're using a framework like Next.js that supports PostCSS plugins, install Tailwind along with our new dedicated PostCSS plugin:

```bash {{ filename: 'Terminal' }}
$ npm install tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/postcss@next
```

Next, add our PostCSS plugin to your `postcss.config.js` file:

```ts {{ filename: 'postcss.config.mjs' }}
  export default {
    plugins: {
>     '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
    },
  };
```

Finally, import Tailwind into your main CSS file:

```css  {{ filename: 'app.css' }}
> @import "tailwindcss";
```

### Installing the CLI

If you want to use our dedicated CLI tool, install Tailwind along with our new dedicated CLI package:

```bash {{ filename: 'Terminal' }}
$ npm install tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/cli@next
```

Next, import Tailwind into your main CSS file:

```css  {{ filename: 'app.css' }}
> @import "tailwindcss";
```

Then compile your CSS using the CLI tool:
```bash {{ filename: 'Terminal' }}
$ npx @tailwindcss/cli -i input.css -o output.css
```

You can also download [standalone builds](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v4.0.0-beta-1) of the new CLI tool from GitHub for projects that don't otherwise depend on the Node.js ecosystem.

### Upgrading from v3

If you'd like to try upgrading a project from v3 to the v4 beta releases, you can use our upgrade tool to do the vast majority of the heavy lifting for you:

```bash {{ filename: 'Terminal' }}
$ npx @tailwindcss/upgrade@next
```

For most projects, the upgrade tool will automate the entire migration process including:

- **Updating dependencies** like Tailwind itself, adding the new PostCSS plugin, updating our Prettier plugin if you have it installed, and removing dependencies that are no longer needed like `postcss-import` and `autoprefixer`.
- **Replacing `@tailwind` directives with `@import "tailwindcss"`** to modernize your project.
- **Migrating your config file to CSS** if possible, or updating your CSS to import your config file with `@config`.
- **Replacing deprecated utility classes** with their v4 equivalents, like renaming `outline-none` to `outline-hidden`.
- **Updating your variant order** so that order-sensitive variants in your utilities are sorted from left to right instead of right to left.
- **Replacing `theme(…)` with `var(…)`** where possible, taking advantage of the CSS variables generated in v4.0 by default.
- **Migrating to the new variable shorthand syntax**, updating utilities like `bg-[--my-color]` to `bg-(--my-color)`.
- **Adding compatibility base styles for Preflight changes**, so your project looks the same after upgrading.
- **Updating custom utilities to use `@utility`** instead of just custom classes in the `utilities` layer.
- **Updating existing imports to use layers** to make sure your custom styles behave as expected with Tailwind's layered styles.

**We recommend running the upgrade tool in a new branch**, then carefully reviewing the diff and testing your project in the browser to make sure all of the changes look correct. You may need to tweak a few things by hand in complex projects, but the tool will save you a ton of time either way.

It's also a good idea to go over all of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes) in v4.0 and get a good understanding of what's changed, in case there are other things you need to update in your project that the upgrade tool doesn't catch.
